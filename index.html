I need to access my AdMob Account which I was using years ago, because I made a new App and I want to use AdMob with it.

If I go to AdMob I get the following Messages:

Michael you cannot use AdMob at this time. You do not have access to the AdSense account that is connected to your AdMob account.

If I go to AdSense I can not log in and cancel my AdSense Account because it wants me to link a Website with the AdSense script in the Header, but this site I is not existing anymore and I don not have a Website to put in the Script.

Are there some ways to cancel my AdSense Account to get Access to my AdMob Account again? Or should I set up a complete new Account to use AdMob again? If yes are there any issues using the same Payment Informations as in the old Account??

Thanks in advance
