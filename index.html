    <p>



We care about your privacy, therefore we do not collect any personally identifiable data from your use of the app. The only data we collect are crash logs provided by Apple, 
        this means that if the app crashes, it sends Apple some details regarding why the App crashed, it contains absolutely no personal details, 
        and we only get this if you have opt-in to Apple's data collection.
<br/>
We hope this is clear, and once again, we care very much about privacy and do not want to have any of your details what so ever!
<br/>
Any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch.
